# AppPerformanceTestingPlatform
Stress testing is crucial for understanding how your application behaves under heavy load. For machine learning-powered APIs, it is especially important because model inference can be CPU-intensive. By simulating a large number of users, we can identify performance bottlenecks, determine the capacity of our system, and ensure reliability.
